# Developer

## Context

AI development typically requires highly skilled data scientists or machine learning engineers, often with advanced degrees and specialized knowledge in model building and evaluation. Large corporations usually employ teams of such experts to implement AI across various business units. However, for smaller companies and individual researchers, the costs associated with hiring qualified personnel and accessing computational resources like GPUs can be prohibitively high.

A standardized AI platform could democratize access, enabling those with basic AI skills to train, test, and deploy models efficiently, with just a few clicks. This approach also offers significant cost savings, sparing users from the high expenses associated with platforms like AWS for testing and development.

## Nimble's Value

### AI Development SDK

Nimble aims to redefine the efficiency of AI development. Our user-friendly SDK allows developers of all skill levels to seamlessly connect with a network of GPUs and data sources. This connection enables them to train models at exceptionally low costs by using Nimble tokens.

### Profitable Model Asset Staking

Developers pay for model training but they have the opportunity to stake their trained models back onto the Nimble network to earn tokens. Furthermore, model owners who buy the stakes can generate ongoing revenue by making their models available for API calls, creating a continuous token stream.

### Community-Driven Innovation

Nimble fosters a vibrant community where developers can share insights, tools, and models. This collaborative environment not only speeds up the AI development process but also enhances the overall quality of models through peer reviews and shared expertise. By participating in this community, developers gain access to a wealth of collective knowledge and cutting-edge AI developments, pushing the boundaries of what they can achieve individually.
