# For GPU Miners

The operating system and GPU model you use plays a crucial role in the setup process for mining on the Nimble Network. Whether you're using Mac, Windows, or Linux, each platform has its unique configuration requirements and steps. To assist you in navigating this process, we have tailored setup guidelines for each operating system.

Please refer to the table of contents on the left side of this page to select the setup guide that corresponds to your operating system. If a document does not specify an operating system, it can be assumed that the instructions are universally applicable to all platforms.
