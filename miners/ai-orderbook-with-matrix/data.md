# Data

## Context

Just as the engine powers a car, data fuels AI models. The quality and specificity of data, analogous to the type of gasoline, critically influences the performance of machine learning models. High-quality, well-prepared data enables GPUs to operate at peak efficiency, enhancing outcomes in tasks such as model training and predictive analysis.

The principle "bigger is better" doesn't always hold in the realm of data either. While the original Llama 70B was trained on 1 trillion tokens—enabling it to answer general questions—addressing more specific queries requires what could be likened to nitrous oxide (N2O) for cars: private, high-quality data. By integrating such specialized data and employing fine-tuning techniques, models can be tailored to perform specific tasks exceptionally well.

In essence, data shapes the capabilities and effectiveness of AI models.

## Nimble's Value

### On-chain & Off-chain Data Availability

Recognizing the pivotal role of data, Nimble has established robust connections with a diverse range of data providers from the outset. Our network integrates both on-chain and off-chain sources, making datasets from sectors like GameFi, DeFi, and SocialFi trainable within our ecosystem. Furthermore, Nimble collaborates with traditional web2 data companies in healthcare, finance, and consumer industries to ensure a comprehensive data landscape.

### Data Staking

What's more, data providers are incentivized to contribute their resources through the Nimble network by staking their data in exchange for Nimble tokens. Our model training process leverages these varied data sources and offers additional rewards if the resultant models prove to be of high quality.

### Data Privacy and Security

Nimble employs encryption and blockchain technology to ensure that all data remains secure and private. This not only protects data providers' intellectual property but also builds trust with end-users who rely on the confidentiality and integrity of the data. By implementing these stringent security measures, Nimble facilitates a safe environment where sensitive data can be utilized without compromising privacy or compliance requirements.
