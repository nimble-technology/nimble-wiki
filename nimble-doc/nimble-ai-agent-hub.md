# ðŸ§Š AI Agent Hub

## AI Agent Hub

AI Agent Hub is an open and collaborative platform that empowers AI builders with a comprehensive suite of tools to develop, publish, and monetize AI agents for a wide range of Web2 and Web3 applications. By harnessing collective intelligence, AI builders can create highly specialized AI agents tailored to their clients' specific needs.

## The Concept of AI Agents

AI agents are advanced computer programs capable of autonomous operation. They can perceive their environment, analyze data, predict the result, and take actions to achieve specific tasks.

In Web3, AI agents can be developed using off-chain and on-chain data, which is recorded on-chain as unique assets. These agents can seamlessly interact with other agents across various  blockchains, as well as with humans, and continuously improve their performance based on customer feedback.

## The Development Process of AI Agents&#x20;

The AI Agent Hub provides AI developers with access to a wide range of pre-built AI agent templates, for example, reusable foundation models and a flexible structure to adjust parameters, accelerating the development of custom AI agents. The process involves:

* Template Selection: Developers can choose from pre-built AI agent templates or existing AI agents, rather than starting from scratch.
* Parameter Adjustment: Developers can customize their own AI agents to meet specific requirements.
* Resource Selection: Developers select desired resources, including GPUs and datasets, via AI Notebook. The request is then submitted to AI OrderBook.
* Automatic Training: Once the AI OrderBook matches AI creation tasks with required resources, the training process is initiated automatically.
* Publishing On-Chain: Once trained, the AI agent is created as an asset and published on the Nimble Network.
* Feedback Loop: Users stake Nimble tokens to own AI agents and provide feedback to improve the AI agentâ€™s performance and build a reputation for the AI agents.
* Monetization: Users pay Nimble tokens to access AI agents, with revenue shared among owners. AI Agents can also be traded on the marketplace in the future.&#x20;

## The Ownership of AI Agent &#x20;

Each AI agent is a unique asset on the Nimble Network. They can be owned and controlled by one or multiple owners, thanks to blockchain technology, enabling transparent ownership tracking and fee sharing.

### Interaction and Composability among AI Agents

* **Cross-chain Interaction** \
  \
  The AI Agent Hub enables a collaborative ecosystem where AI agents can interact and integrate with one another through APIs. This allows applications across blockchains to easily access and utilize the AI agents hosted on Nimbleâ€™s AI Agent Hub.\

* **Composability**\
  \
  Furthermore, this interconnectivity enables AI builders to easily integrate these existing AI agents into their workflows, unlocking new levels of functionality and efficiency.

### Collaborative Development&#x20;

The platform actively monitors AI agents' performance, collects user feedback and monitors for anomalies or malicious activities. Users can stake to evaluate AI agents and provide feedback in exchange for staking rewards. This feedback loop ensures the ongoing security and reliability of the ecosystem and helps build trustworthy reputations for AI agents.
