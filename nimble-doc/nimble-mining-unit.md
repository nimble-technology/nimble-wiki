# ⚙️ Nimble Mining Unit

The Nimble Mining Unit Rental Campaign is a new initiative that Nimble collaborates with our third-party GPU operator network, to offer users the most secure, efficient, and user-friendly mining experiences.

## Mining Unit&#x20;

Mining Unit provides a simple and efficient way for users to rent the computing power of H100 GPU from our verified third-party GPU operators, who will then handle the mining process on their behalf. The GPU operators will utilize H100 GPUs to perform AI training tasks on Nimble for the Mining Unit users. In return, Mining Unit users will earn Nimble tokens as mining rewards and 10% of the rewards will be distributed to the GPU operators as an operational fee. This entire mining process can be completed with just a few simple button clicks.

## Why Mining Unit?&#x20;

**For community members**

* Difficulty in accessing high-end GPUs like H100
* High technical entry barrier and operational overheads
* Potential frauds by unverified agents, resulting in financial loss

**For GPU operators**

* High onboarding frictions for AI applications&#x20;
* Limited access to a broader customer base
* Suboptimal revenue due to lack of access to AI applications&#x20;

The Mining Unit Rental Campaign connects our community members with verified third-party GPU operators, enabling collaborative development of a trustless AI future.\
