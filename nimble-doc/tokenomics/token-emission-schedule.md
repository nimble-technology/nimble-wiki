# Token Emission Schedule

The GPU Provider, Evaluator & Validator Reward accounts for 50% of the total token supply, equivalent to 500 million tokens.

At TGE, 300 million tokens will be activated, with the remaining 200 million tokens being emitted over a 20-year period on a deflationary schedule.&#x20;

The token emission follows a set schedule, releasing a specific number of tokens in each block. Initially, these tokens are sent to an incentive pool, which then dynamically distributes rewards based on network demand and activity. This mechanism ensures that rewards are proportional to the network's actual usage.&#x20;
