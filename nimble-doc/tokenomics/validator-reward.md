# Validator Reward

Nimble Network operates as a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, utilizing token staking to secure its network. Validators play a crucial role in securing network security by actively participating in the consensus process, validating transactions, and adding new blocks to the chain. To become a validator, participants must meet a minimum staking requirement.&#x20;

Token holders who don't want to operate a validator node can still support the network's security by delegating their $NIMBLE tokens to validators. Delegators receive a share of the rewards earned by the validators they delegate to, proportional to the amount they've staked.&#x20;

Validators face slashing penalties if they engage in malicious acts or fail to properly fulfill their duties. Slashing is a mechanism that punishes validators by reducing their staked tokens.
