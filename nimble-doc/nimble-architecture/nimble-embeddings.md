# Nimble Embeddings

## Context

At Nimble Network, we recognize the critical importance of privacy and security, especially when it comes to handling sensitive data in on-chain machine learning environments. As we expand our ecosystem, ensuring that all data is protected and used ethically is a must.&#x20;

### Nimble Embeddings

Instead of training models or performing inference on raw data, we use a sophisticated embedding technique. This method involves transforming sensitive data into another dimensional space, which represents the essential information without exposing the raw data. This process not only secures the data but also enhances processing efficiency and protects user privacy.

**1.Privacy Protection**: By converting raw data into embeddings, personal identifiers are removed, ensuring that the data cannot be traced back to any individual.

**2.Reduced Data Abuse Risk**: Embeddings minimize the detailed information that can be exploited, thus significantly lowering the risk of data misuse.

To further safeguard our data of embedding, all communications within the Nimble Network will be encrypted. This encryption applies to data as it moves between nodes and while it is at rest, ensuring that only authorized nodes can access or interpret the information.
