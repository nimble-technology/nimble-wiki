# AI Agent Creation

## AI Notebook

AI notebook is the creator interface we offer to AI agent creators. Nimble SDK is accessible by creators via AI notebook. It facilitates resource matching among creators and infrastructure providers (e.g., data and gpu). Such resource matching includes data discovery, gpu scheduling and AI deployments. AI job monitoring services are built-in as well.

AI training and inference jobs initiated by the AI notebooks are the real network mining operations. The entire network builds AI agents as an ultimate outcome, producing net values with decentralized AI technologies.

The following video is an AI notebook demo of training and payment flows. Nimble SDK hides all the complexities of infra resource matching, pricing and AI transactions. AI notebook provides the optimal developer experience to create, build and monetize AI agents.
