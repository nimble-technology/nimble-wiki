# 🧊 Nimble AI Agent Hub

## AI Agent Hub

The AI Agent Hub is an open, collaborative platform that equips AI builders with a full suite of tools to develop, publish, and monetize AI agents for various web2 and web3 applications. By leveraging collective intelligence, AI builders can create highly specialized AI agents tailored to meet the unique needs of their clients.

## The Concept of AI Agents

AI agents are advanced computer programs designed to operate autonomously. They can perceive their environment, analyze data, predict outcomes, and take actions to accomplish specific tasks.

In the web3 ecosystem, AI agents are developed using both off-chain and on-chain data, which is then recorded on-chain as unique assets. These agents can seamlessly interact both with humans and other agents across different blockchains, continuously refining their performance based on user feedback.

## The Development Process of AI Agents&#x20;

The AI Agent Hub simplifies the creation of AI agents by providing developers with access to a wide range of pre-built templates, such as reusable foundation models, and a flexible structure for parameter adjustment.&#x20;

Here's how the process works:

* **Template Selection:** Developers can choose from pre-built AI agent templates or existing AI agents, rather than build from scratch.
* **Parameter Adjustment:** Developers can customize their own AI agents to meet specific requirements.
* **Resource Selection:** Developers select the necessary resources, including GPUs and datasets, via AI Notebook. The request is then submitted to AI OrderBook.
* **Automatic Training:** Once the AI OrderBook matches AI creation tasks with the required resources, the training process is initiated automatically.
* **Publishing On-Chain:** Once trained, the AI agent is converted into an on-chain asset and published on Nimble Network.
* **Feedback Loop:** Users stake NIM tokens to own AI agents and provide feedback to improve the AI agent’s performance and build its reputation.
* **Monetization:** Users can access AI agents by paying with NIM tokens, with revenue shared among the owners. Additionally, AI agents can be traded on the marketplace in the future.

## Ownership of AI Agents &#x20;

Each AI agent on the Nimble Network is a unique asset, offering transparent ownership and control through blockchain technology. This setup allows one or multiple owners to track ownership and share fees seamlessly.

### Interaction and Composability among AI Agents

* **Cross-chain Interaction** \
  \
  The AI Agent Hub fosters a collaborative ecosystem where AI agents can interact and integrate with each other via APIs. This enables applications across different blockchains to easily access and utilize the AI agents hosted on Nimble’s AI Agent Hub.\

* **AI Agent Composability**\
  \
  This interconnectivity also allows AI builders to integrate existing AI agents into their workflows, unlocking new levels of functionality and efficiency.

### Collaborative Development&#x20;

The platform actively monitors AI agents' performance, collects user feedback and detects for anomalies or malicious activities. Users can stake NIM tokens to evaluate AI agents and provide feedback, earning rewards in the process. This feedback loop ensures the ongoing security and reliability of the ecosystem, while also helping to build trustworthy reputations for AI agents.
