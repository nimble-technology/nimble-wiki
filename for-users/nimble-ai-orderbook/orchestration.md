# Orchestration

## Context

The world is full of isolated information islands—ranging from business use cases and computational power to human expertise and data. There are needs on one side and resources on the other. \
\
To bridge this gap and effectively represent this multi-faceted information, we utilize the **Nimble Matrix** as the foundational element that flows throughout the ecosystem. This Matrix is processed, assembled, validated, and committed within the Nimble Network

## OrderBook Design

Nimble’s primary goal is to execute the Matrix with maximum efficiency. To achieve this, the AI OrderBook is structured into three key phases:

* **Matching**: Identifies all potential combinations that meet the criteria of each participant.
* **Pricing**: Candidates bid to secure the most favorable economic outcomes.
* **Transaction**: This phase records the actual execution of training or inferencing.

For a clearer understanding, refer to the diagram below, which illustrates how matching, pricing, and transactions are sequentially executed for each Nimble Matrix, particularly in the context of AI training.
