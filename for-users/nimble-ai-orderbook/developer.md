# Developer

## Context

AI development often requires specialized knowledge and expertise, typically found in highly skilled data scientists or machine learning engineers with advanced degrees. Large corporations can afford teams of such experts to implement AI across various business units, but for smaller companies and individual researchers, the costs of hiring qualified personnel and accessing computational resources like GPUs can be prohibitively high.

A standardized AI platform like Nimble's could democratize access, enabling those with basic AI skills to efficiently train, test, and deploy models, with just a few clicks. This approach also offers significant cost savings, sparing users from the high expenses associated with platforms like AWS for testing and development.

## Nimble's Value

### AI Development SDK

Nimble aims to make AI development more accessible and efficient. Our intuitive SDK allows developers of all skill levels to easily connect with a network of GPUs and data sources. \
This way, they can train models at exceptionally low costs using $NIM tokens..

### Profitable Model Asset Staking

Developers not only pay for model training but also have the opportunity to stake their trained models back onto the Nimble network to earn tokens. Model owners who buy the stakes can generate ongoing revenue by making their models available for API calls, creating a continuous token stream.

### Community-Driven Innovation

Nimble fosters a vibrant community where developers can share insights, tools, and models. This environment accelerates the AI development process and enhances model quality through peer reviews and shared expertise. By engaging with this community, developers gain access to a wealth of collective knowledge and cutting-edge AI advancements, allowing them to achieve more than they could on their own.
