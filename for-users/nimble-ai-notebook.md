# Nimble AI Notebook

## AI Agent Creation

The AI Notebook is our user-friendly interface designed for AI agent creators. Through the Nimble SDK, creators can easily access resources like data and GPUs, facilitating seamless resource matching, GPU scheduling, and AI deployments. Plus, it includes built-in job monitoring services to keep everything running smoothly.

When developers use the AI Notebook to start AI training and inference jobs, they’re participating in the core mining operations of the Nimble network. The goal is to build AI agents that deliver real value using decentralized AI technology.

Watch the video demo below to see the AI Notebook in action, showcasing how easy it is to handle training and payment flows. The Nimble SDK takes care of all the complexities of resource matching, pricing, and AI transactions, so developers can focus on creating, building, and monetizing their AI agents with ease.
