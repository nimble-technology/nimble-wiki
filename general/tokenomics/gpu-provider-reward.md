# GPU Provider Reward

The GPU Provider Reward mechanism incentivizes the contribution of computing resources to maintain network stability and balance short-term rewards with the network's long-term growth.&#x20;

The reward system has three key components:&#x20;

`Total Reward = Usage Fee + Computing Reward + Proof of Commitment Reward`

### **Usage Fee**

`Final Usage Fee = Usage Fee x (1 - Network Fee%)`

GPU Providers charge clients a Usage Fee based on the computing resources required for the task and the client's willingness to pay. Nimble Network will then collect a 5% Network Fee from the Usage Fee to cover network maintenance and development.

### Computing Reward

`Computing Reward = Reputation Score x Base Computing Reward`&#x20;

A GPU Provider's Reputation Score is determined by their performance record and trustworthiness. Higher-scoring providers will be prioritized for more AI tasks, encouraging them to maintain a strong professional reputation. GPU Providers can boost their Reputation Score by staking more $NIM tokens, consistently fulfilling AI tasks, and avoiding fraudulent activities.

The Base Computing Incentive is calculated based on the number of AI tasks completed, their complexity, and the GPU model used. An AI OrderBook system efficiently matches computing needs with available resources, ensuring optimal pricing and execution of AI tasks. This dynamic system allows for efficient resource allocation and adjusting fees and rewards based on real-time market conditions.

### Proof of Commitment (PoC) Reward&#x20;

GPU Providers are rewarded for committing their computing power to the network through the Proof of Commitment (PoC) system. This approach ensures that providers' hardware is always ready for use when required, contributing to a stable and efficient infrastructure.

Key features of the Proof of Commitment system include:

1. Lightweight Application: The PoC system uses a lightweight application with <1% resource usage of a GPU. It does not affect electricity consumption or resource availability for other tasks.
2. Multi-GPU Support: A single wallet address can now connect multiple GPUs, easier for wallet management
3. Real-time Updates: Token quantities are updated in almost real-time and are easily accessible due to improvements in the overall technical structure.
