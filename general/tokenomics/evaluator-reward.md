# Evaluator Reward

Evaluators are responsible for assessing the performance of AI tasks executed by other GPU Providers. Rewards are calculated using a mechanism similar to that of GPU providers. Evaluators are selected randomly from the top 10% of GPU Providers based on their Reputation Score. This selection process takes place for each block, ensuring a fair distribution of evaluation responsibilities among the most qualified GPU Providers.
