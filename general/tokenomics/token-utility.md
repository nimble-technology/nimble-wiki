# Token Utility

The $NIMBLE token, the native token of the Nimble Network, is designed to power and secure the ecosystem. It serves several key functions:

#### **Universal Payment**

$NIMBLE is used to pay transaction fees on the Nimble Chain and is the primary medium of exchange for services within the network, including payments for compute resources, data, AI development tools, and other network utilities. In the near future, we will introduce more options for users to pay with fiat or stablecoins. As an incentive to promote the use of $NIMBLE tokens, we will apply a 2% conversion fee for transactions involving fiat and stablecoins, while transactions made with $NIMBLE tokens will have a 0% fee.

#### **Network Security**

Participants must stake $NIMBLE tokens as collateral to secure the network's AI computation and blockchain validation. GPU Providers stake to perform the AI tasks. Evaluators stake to assess the performance of AI tasks. Validators stake to validate the transactions on Nimble Chain. This aligns participants' economic incentives with the network's objectives and stability, while penalties for misconduct help ensure the integrity of the system.

#### **Rewards for Contributors**&#x20;

The token incentivizes GPU providers, data providers, and AI developers to contribute their resources and expertise to the Nimble Network.

#### **Exclusive Benefits**&#x20;

$NIMBLE holders gain exclusive access to advanced AI toolings and AI agents, and can earn additional rewards through active participation in the ecosystem.

#### **Governance**

$NIMBLE holders have a voice in the platform's governance, enabling them to propose and vote on decisions that improve the network. This ensures that the community actively participates in the network's development.
