# Token Emission Schedule

The GPU Provider, Evaluator & Validator Reward accounts for 50% of the total token supply, equivalent to 500 million tokens.

**Initial Activation and Long-term Emission**

* At the Token Generation Event (TGE), 300 million tokens will be activated for potential distribution.
* The remaining 200 million tokens will be activated gradually over a 20-year period following a deflationary schedule.

**Important:** Activated tokens are not immediately circulated. They enter an incentive pool ready for use but only dynamically distributed as rewards. This distribution adapts to real-time network activity and user participation, ensuring rewards match actual usage.

The initial circulating supply at TGE is expected to be around 5% of the total supply, allocated for community and launch activities, including pre-TGE mining rewards.

The token emission follows a set schedule, releasing a specific number of tokens in each block. Initially, these tokens are sent to an incentive pool, which then dynamically distributes rewards based on network demand and activity. This mechanism ensures that rewards are proportional to the network's actual usage.&#x20;
