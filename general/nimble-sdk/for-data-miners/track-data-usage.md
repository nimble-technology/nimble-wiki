# Track Data Usage

Once your datasets are published on the Nimble Network, they become accessible to on-chain models applications. Every time your datasets are accessed, you earn tokens. Below are the steps on how to track access and manage your earnings using the `nimble-cli.`&#x20;

## **Tracking Data Usage**

To understand how your data is being used, the NimbleData SDK provides tools to monitor usage statistics, including the frequency of access and usage details:

```python
nimble-cli view data
--id
```

## **Monitoring Earnings**

If your primary concern is tracking how much you earn from your data contributions, the SDK simplifies this as well:

```python
nimble-cli view data
--id
--earnings
```
