## Where Are We Now?

Our system is currently live for distributing AI tasks, evaluating their training status, and sending rewards through an automated evaluation flow called the evaluator (for our AI orderbook Alpha version).&#x20;

Additionally, we've developed an AI notebook prototype to onboard new developers.

## Q3 2024

#### Chain Layer Transition & Reputation System&#x20;

We aim to move AI task matching to the Chain layer as part of our AI orderbook beta version. We'll also stabilize the evaluator service to enhance security and streamline operations by removing unnecessary logic.,&#x20;

Additionally, we plan to finalize the implementation of a staking, reputation, and slashing system to eliminate manual wallet approval.

#### The AI Notebook Public Launch&#x20;

Next, we plan to launch a fully-fledged AI notebook service to the public, enabling anyone to create, publish, and monetize AI agents. This service will be integrated with the Chain layer for AI agent creation.&#x20;

We also aim to establish an AI Agent Hub for monetizing models and AI agents, and onboard more web3 developers. Further enhancements will include improving the AI agent use case, the orderbook matching mechanism, and the UI/UX for GPU miners and developers.

#### Network Stabilization&#x20;

In the meantime, we're working towards stabilizing the AI notebook, AI orderbook, and AI agent hub solutions, with a continued focus on training.

## Q4 2024

#### Nimble AI Assets

In Q4, our focus will shift to developing AI assets and onboarding web2 AI developers and applications to create a comprehensive product ecosystem. We will continue to expand the network by integrating more AI applications and refining AI agents for domain-specific fine-tuning and inferencing support.

#### Fully Fledged Ecosystem

We will also prioritize data privacy enhancements, B2B industry-tailored AI training solutions (e.g., finance, gaming), and multi-chain support for AI agents.
