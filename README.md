# 🔅 Overview

## What is Nimble

Nimble is the first open AI network to accelerate open AI innovations, by solving the problems of a) AI centralization, b) compute scarcity, and c) incentive misalignments.

Nimble's mission is to transform the AI ecosystem by enabling decentralization, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This empowers applications to spend less on building AI models and developers to reduce expenses on GPUs. This also makes AI accessible to a broader audience, allowing everyone to experiment with AI technology on their own. Additionally, GPU and data providers can monetize their participation in the Nimble Network.

The solution is a decentralized AI orchestration network (aka. AI OrderBook) that connects applications, developers, GPU resources and data on the blockchain for efficient, low cost and permissionless AI model training and inferencing. To build optimal developer experience, AI notebook is the unified developer interface built to access GPUs, data and job status very easily. The unique AI asset and network staking design gives AI development and model ownerships back to users.

## What is Nimble Token

The Nimble Network facilitates a variety of transaction types including training models, publishing models, staking models, publishing data, and using GPUs. Each transaction incurs a pair of earning and paying, which is denominated in Nimble Tokens—the official currency of the network.

## Validators

Validators in the Nimble Network execute complex algorithms to ensure the trustworthiness of transactions. They employ a range of AI/ML techniques for training validation, model quality assessment, data validation, and staking validation. Each validator specializes in no more than one aspect but must perform it exceptionally well. Furthermore, each type of validation requires the consensus of multiple validators. As the network scales horizontally, the number of validators—or algorithms—must also increase. Cross-validation is crucial to maintaining trustworthiness and identifying and penalizing inadequate validators.

## Consensus

Given the inherent non-determinism of AI/ML processes, the Nimble Network achieves consensus when the majority of validators approve a transaction. This voting mechanism is both fair and mathematically sound.

## Rewards

Nimble offers rewards primarily to GPU miners and data providers, who are pivotal to the AI infrastructure. These rewards ensure the stability of the infrastructure and the availability of comprehensive data for model training and inference.

## Staking

In addition to supporting token staking—a common feature across many chains—Nimble's unique ecosystem also allows for the staking of models and data. These are considered "assets," and owners can earn Nimble tokens by sharing their models and data, which are then utilized by others within the ecosystem.

## Inflation

The inflation rate for Nimble is set at 0%. This is designed to maintain the purchasing power of the Nimble Token and ensure a stable economic environment within the network.
