# Introduction

## Nimble: The First Open AI Network for the AI Sharing Economy

Welcome to Nimble, the **first open network** designed to create the AI sharing economy.&#x20;

With Nimble, anyone can build, own, and profit from AI agents using the most optimal computing and data resources, along with advanced machine learning services.

Nimble is committed to fostering an open and collaborative AI creator economy. Here, AI agents can be developed with ease, interact seamlessly, and transact freely within an open market.

Explore the boundless possibilities with Nimble - where the future of AI is in your hands.

## The Journey of AI: From Centralization to Decentralization&#x20;

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone remarkable advancements since its inception, transforming from a concept in the minds of scientists to powerful applications like ChatGPT. However, today's AI landscape faces significant challenges due to centralization. Several crucial components necessary for AI advancement, ranging from resources (such as computational power, datasets, and models), to development tools (such as GPU scheduling and Machine Learning workflow management) and AI products (such as AI agents), are primarily controlled by a few major tech companies and are not easily accessible to the public.

### **Current Challenges in AI Development**

* **Accessibility Barrier**: Smaller companies and individuals often struggle to access the cost-effective computational power and diverse datasets needed to develop their own AI products.
* **Innovation Bottleneck**: Closed-source models restrict innovation. Major tech companies may not meet the diverse needs of all users, limiting options and slowing the pace of tailored solutions.
* **Closed AI Systems**: Most major tech firms have closed AI systems and don't open for collaboration. This leads to difficulties in scaling efficiently due to suboptimal resource allocation. AI agents developed in such environments often cannot interact with each other, hindering collaboration and interoperability.
* **Incentive Misalignment:** There's little incentive for closed AI systems to share GPUs, data, and models, leading to inefficiencies and underutilization. Also, general users are not rewarded for their data contribution.&#x20;
* **Security Concerns:** The lack of transparency in centralized AI systems raises concerns about computational integrity and data privacy.&#x20;

### **The Promise of Decentralization**

Blockchain technology, with its attributes of permissionless access, interoperability, cryptographic security, and incentive structures, offers a promising solution to these challenges. While several new AI solutions have emerged in the Web3 world, an efficient Web2-like development experience is yet to be realized.

Nimble aims to bridge this gap with an open AI network that empowers anyone to build, own, and profit from their AI agents, all while providing a seamless development experience akin to Web2.&#x20;

## Nimble's Solution &#x20;

To create an open and collaborative AI creator economy, Nimble is building an open AI Network. This network supports the entire machine learning workflow, from AI training to fine-tuning and inference. Nimble’s technical architecture is designed to:

### **Nimble Chain: AI-centric App Chain built on Cosmos SDK**&#x20;

Nimble Chain is the core foundation of Nimble built on Cosmos SDK, consisting of an execution layer of AI computation and a consensus layer of validating and recording the transactions to the chain. All AI activities are immutably recorded on the Nimble Chain.

#### **AI Computation**

Miners are responsible for executing AI tasks. To ensure the performance of miners, a Staking mechanism and a Permissionless Reputation System will be introduced. AI tasks will be distributed to Miners based on their reputation and stake. Evaluators are responsible for regularly checking the performance of Miners’ work.

#### Consensus&#x20;

Nimble Chain relies on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to achieve consensus. Nimble validators process transactions and settle state changes on the network. Validators are selected to produce blocks according to their total stake (self-staked plus delegated Nimble Token).&#x20;

#### Interoperability

Nimble Chain will enable interoperability with multiple chains. Dapps from multiple chain ecosystems can easily integrate the AI solutions from Nimble into their product.

### Nimble Core: Your one-stop shop for AI development&#x20;

Nimble introduces three core functionalities to unlock an efficient and scalable AI development:&#x20;

* **AI Notebook**: An all-in-one developer platform that provides Web2-like development experience&#x20;
* **AI OrderBook**: An efficient orchestration engine that optimizes machine learning workflow with the most optimal GPU and data
* **AI Agent Hub**: An open and collaborative hub providing diverse AI agents for Web2 and Web3 application use cases
