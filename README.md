# ðŸ”… Overview

## What is Nimble

Nimble is a decentralized AI orchestration layer (aka. AI Orderbook) that connects applications, developers, model training, GPU resources, and data on the blockchain. Nimble's mission is to transform the AI ecosystem by reducing costs and increasing efficiency. This enables applications to spend less on building AI models and developers to reduce expenses on GPU rentals. Additionally, GPU and data providers can monetize their participation in the Nimble Network.

## What is Nimble Token

The Nimble Network facilitates a variety of transaction types including training models, publishing models, staking models, publishing data, and using GPUs. Each transaction incurs a pair of earning and paying, which is denominated in Nimble Tokensâ€”the official currency of the network.

## Validators

Validators in the Nimble Network execute complex algorithms to ensure the trustworthiness of transactions. They employ a range of AI/ML techniques for training validation, model quality assessment, data validation, and staking validation. Each validator specializes in no more than one aspect but must perform it exceptionally well. Furthermore, each type of validation requires the consensus of multiple validators. As the network scales horizontally, the number of validatorsâ€”or algorithmsâ€”must also increase. Cross-validation is crucial to maintaining trustworthiness and identifying and penalizing inadequate validators.

## Consensus

Given the inherent non-determinism of AI/ML processes, the Nimble Network achieves consensus when the majority of validators approve a transaction. This voting mechanism is both fair and mathematically sound.

## Rewards

Nimble offers rewards primarily to GPU miners and data providers, who are pivotal to the AI infrastructure. These rewards ensure the stability of the infrastructure and the availability of comprehensive data for model training and inference.

## Staking

In addition to supporting token stakingâ€”a common feature across many chainsâ€”Nimble's unique ecosystem also allows for the staking of models and data. These are considered "assets," and owners can earn Nimble tokens by sharing their models and data, which are then utilized by others within the ecosystem.

## Inflation

The inflation rate for Nimble is set at 0%. This is designed to maintain the purchasing power of the Nimble Token and ensure a stable economic environment within the network.
